# MSc_Ch1_DataPrep
Data prep for Chapter 1 of my PhD thesis. 

Data sets include species occurrence data for blue, midnight, and rainbow parrotfishes, as well as gray snapper and bluestriped grunt. Environmental predictors for these species were too large to store on GitHub but can be made available upon request.

Data coverage includes most of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) and Biscayne National Park (BNP).
