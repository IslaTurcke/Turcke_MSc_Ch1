# Welcome!
This repository houses cleaned input data, R scripts, ArcGIS workflows, and many of the datasets generated during Chapter 1 of my PhD at the University of Alberta. 

This work, titled " ", is currently submitted for publication to Landscape Ecology: special collection "Seascape ecology as a solution-focused science".

## Input datasets:
1. Species occurrence data for blue, midnight, and rainbow parrotfishes, as well as gray snapper and bluestriped grunt.
   From two sources: Reef Visual Census (RVC) and Mangrove Visual Survey (MVS).
   Found in this repository.
2. Spatial-environmental predictors including habitat type, bathymetrics (measures of seafloor complexity), and indices of water quality.
   Data coverage includes most of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) and Biscayne National Park (BNP).
   These data are too large to store on GitHub but can be made available upon request.

## Output datasets:
1. Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) output files - summarizing the results of habitat suitability models.
   Maps of predicted habitat suitability are too large to store on GitHub but can be made available upon request.
2. Data tables quantifying the predicted habitat suitability of management zones found in the study region.
   Suitability by zone name, zone ID, and zone type are all available in this repository.
